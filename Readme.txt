Make at least one of the following changes.  You may choose to do more, but you are only required to do one.

1) Change the application so that every distinct user who logs in has access to only their own notes.

2) Allow users to apply arbitrary tags to each note and to filter the main list of notes by a selected tag.

3) Add a search feature.  The search must be server-side: in other words, the UI must make a call to the server to ask for filtered results.

4) Introduce a unit-testing project and implement at least one unit test for a controller.
